    "**The Data**: This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**: Through this notebook we aim to better understand customer behaviour as well as trends in sales, and to use this information to answer business questions. We look at new customer aquisition through time and repeat purchase rates, as we want to segment customers based on how much value they are likely to bring in the future. Also, we check which products/categories each one of our segments prefer and which ones are more troublesome. Finally, we build a collaborative filtering based recommender system.\n",
